Gameplay Summary:
---
Egg with Legg will consist of 3 puzzle-platformer levels for the player to traverse, with each level slightly increasing in difficulty to allow for a more fun and challenging experience. Each level will contain several collectables (toast) that players will be rewarded for collecting, with rewards including an increase in player’s score and special character skins. However, players will need to navigate each level carefully, as there will be numerous enemies present including “Hammers”, which will move vertically and attempt to crush the player, and “Deviled Eggs”, which will patrol a designated region and lock on to the player when in proximity.

Development Objectives:
---
The main objectives of this development phase are to refine and expand upon the current iteration of the game, this will be done through the following: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Simplifying and modularising the pre-existing code \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Creating classes for entities, terrain, etc. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Breaking up large code blocks into unique functions and methods. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Creating a modular and simpler physics engine, possible switching to Box2D

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Implementing features that weren’t implemented during the initial phase of development \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Toast collectables \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Bouncy platforms \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Menu screen \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Additional player skins \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Hammer enemy \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Audio \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Further animations to entities (Eggy death animation, etc.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Creating an installer for the game

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Expanding upon the enemy AI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Creating and maintaining accurate documentation and comments for code
